interface Interface1 {
    public void add(int a, int b);

    public void multiply(int a, int b);
}
// N.B :
// 1. Any class has to use interface by using keyword 'implements'
// 2. all methods inside interface are treated as abstract bydefault
// 3. you can create as many interface as you want and
// implements any of them or all of them together in main class
